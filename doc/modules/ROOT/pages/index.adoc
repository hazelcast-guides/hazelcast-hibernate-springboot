= Getting Started with Hazelcast and Hibernate Second-Level Cache

This guide will get you started to use Hazelcast in a Spring Boot application. You can see the code sample {github-address}[here].

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide, you'll see how to quickly set up a Spring Boot application using Hazelcast as Hibernate's second-level cache.

== Prerequisites

- ~10 minutes
include::{templates-url}/microservices/prerequisites.adoc[]

In order to run the code sample, make sure to have PostgresSQL database accessible and configured properly in the `application.properties` file.

[TIP]
====
You can spin-up a PostgreSQL instance easily using Docker:
----
docker run --name 2lc-postgres --publish 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:13
----
====

== Configuration

In order to enable JPA, you need to add a dedicated Spring Boot Starter:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In order to configure Hazelcast as second-level cache provider, you need to add two dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-hibernate53</artifactId>
    <version>${hazelcast-hibernate.version}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>${hazelcast.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

And then, we need to configure Hazelcast IMDG local member setting by adding a standard `hazelcast.xml` file into `src/main/resources`.

Keep in mind that this might trigger the autoconfiguration of another Hazelcast member so you might want to disable Hazelcast autoconfiguration:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = HazelcastAutoConfiguration.class)
----

The last step involves turning on second-level cache by adding two properties into `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.region.factory_class=com.hazelcast.hibernate.HazelcastCacheRegionFactory
----

And now, once you annotate your entity as `@Cacheable`, it will be cached in Hazelcast member:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_WRITE)
public class Book { ... }
----

== Running the Application

Run the application by executing the following command.

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

You should see in logs that Hazelcast members started successfully.

----
Members {size:1, ver:1} [
        Member [172.21.28.181]:5701 - f3984396-0ec9-40c8-861e-cb34f14d7204 this
]
----

What happens then is that an object is saved to the database and then fetched. In the meantime the object is stored in the second level cache. `SecondLevelCacheVisualizer` prints out the L2C content in every 10 seconds. 

----
20:56:46.937644
size: 1
    com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book#1:read-write Item(CacheEntry(com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book))

20:56:56.997365
size: 1
    com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book#1:read-write Item(CacheEntry(com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book))
----

The object is then evicted from the L2C after 30 seconds, which is the configured time-to-live in `hazelcast.xml`.

----
20:57:17.028600
size: 0
----

== Summary

In this guide, we bootstrapped a Spring Boot application which uses Hazelcast as Hibernate's second-level cache.
